This folder contains the notebook that applies that deep Galerkin method to the finite-state ergodic master equation, arising from mean field games.

The reference for the finite-state ergodic master equation is: 

Asaf Cohen, Ethan Zell. _Analysis of the Finite-State Ergodic Master Equation_. Appl Math Optim 87, 40 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00245-022-09954-0

The algorithm is used in the preprint:

Asaf Cohen, Ethan Zell. _Asymptotic Nash Equilibria of Finite-State Ergodic Markovian Mean Field Games_.
